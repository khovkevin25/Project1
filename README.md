# Project 1: Work Environments/Locations and its Effects on Mental Health and Lifestyles

## Group 1: Jennifer Foster, Marie Louise Iraba, Indya Jones, Kevin Khov, Geniya Merriweather, William Payne

For this project, our group was interested in analyzing a dataset to compare the potential effects of work locations (remote, hybird, onsite) on various metrics regarding mental health and lifestyles. We hypothesized that working remotely would have a correlation to having a mental health condition, such as anxiety, depression, or burnout.

The main file with our code and subsequent visualizations, analyses, and conclusions can be found in the file "Project1_Group1.ipynb". All CSV files that were used and created in our analysis are in the folder "Data Files" under "Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv" (initial dataset), "clean_data.csv" and "clean_data_gender.csv" (subsequent datasets created for analysis).

The following links were also used as a reference for creating some of the code in our analysis:
  In order to create a grouped chart, we referenced the code in the below link, which breaks down a how to do this.

  In the section comparing region to mental health, we nested a code that divides two lists using zip and list comprehension. We got this specific code from the below link:
